I have never met such a committed servant of God like Daddy Awokoya Mathew. He lived more spiritually than human because he spent more time nourishing his spirit man than eating physical food. He denied himself pleasures of this world to go preaching the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ in places where nobody desired to go. He endured war places to serve the communities there in. He rebuked with compassion and was always there to teach those in and out of Church. I could write a whole book about you but we spare that for another day. Rest in Peace Papa. Will see you again in heaven.
