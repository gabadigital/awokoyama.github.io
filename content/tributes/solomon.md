We learnt with shock the passing on of "the old soldier", our dear Pastor Mathew Awokoya in Lagos in the wee hours of Saturday 12 of December, 2020.

We believe he fought a good fight throughout his sojourn here on earth. His was an unalloyed commitment to the cause of Christ from start to finish.

Apart from Biblical characters, he also has left sterling examples of uncommon missionary zeal for us to emulate. We will miss him for his rare and unpretended relationship with the younger Pastors and missionaries.

He always had a story to tell, with a smile, to shore up our waning faith on the field. He was always radiant with anecdotes that were instructive: Like telling Princess, the second daughter, "how can a newly married woman carry excess luggage to her new matrimonial home". Princess got the message.

And this one, talking about our young ones today: He said “I envy these young ones.”When they marry we do it for them. When they are pregnant we are in it together. And when they bring forth their babies, with Skype technology we are fully involved. We did not enjoy such a luxury in our time".  What a husband, father, christian, servant of God, Pastor, and missionary.
Adeus, “the old soldier that never dies"!

Rest in the bossom of the Lord to receive your crowning reward. (2 Timothy 4:7, 8).
